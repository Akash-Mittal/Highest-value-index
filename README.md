# Highest value index

Implement the `warmup.MyWarmup.findMax(int[] array)` method that returns the position of the highest value in the array, or -1 if the array is empty.

If the highest value occurs more than once, return the position of it's **first** occurence in the `array`.

Sample Input and Output:
```
[1,2,3,0,-1] should return 2.
[1,2,2,1] should return 1.
[] should return -1.
```
