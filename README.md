# Warm up Excercise
Use this task as opportunity to familiarize yourself with the testing tool, learn the coding task general structure and set up your work environment without the pressure of time.
Please mind that the test timer has already started, so you need to finish this and the following tasks in one go.

This task is a warm up excercise - it is meant for you to learn the environment not for us to assess your skills. The following tasks will take care of that - they have more ambitious requirements and realistic timebox.

This task has similar structure and is similar level of detail of the description as the actual tasks that follow. 

## Highest value index

Implement the `warmup.MyWarmup.findMax(int[] array)` method that returns the position of the highest value in the array, or -1 if the array is empty.
If the highest value occurs more than once, return the position of it's **first** occurence in the `array`.

Sample Input:
```
[1,2,3,0,-1] should return 2.
[1,2,2,1] should return 1.
[] should return -1.
```

Your solution must be implemented in the existing `warmup.MyWarmup` class implementing the `Warmup` interface.
You can add tests to the `MyWarmupTest` class and **Build** the project to self-assess your solution.
